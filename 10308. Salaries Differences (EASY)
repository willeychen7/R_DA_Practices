-- Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries 
found in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the absolute difference in salaries.

Table 1: db_employee
+-----------------------+
id            |   int   |
first_name    | varchar |
last_name     | varchar |
salary        |   int   |
department_id |   int   |
+-----------------------+

Table 2: db_dept
+--------------------+
id         |   int   |
department | varchar |
+--------------------+


## 1. SQL Solution
SELECT ABS(max(max_salary) - min(max_salary))
FROM(
    SELECT
        max(e.salary) AS max_salary, d.department
    FROM  db_employee e
    LEFT JOIN db_dept d
    ON e.department_id = d.id
    WHERE 
        d.department = 'engineering' OR 
        d.department = 'marketing'
    GROUP BY e.department_id, d.department) t

## 2. R Solution
# Import your libraries
library(dplyr)

# Start writing code
result <- db_employee %>%
  left_join(db_dept, by = c("department_id" = "id")) %>%
  filter(department %in% c("marketing","engineering")) %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  summarize(m_salary = max(salary))

# Calculate the absolute difference
abs_difference <- abs(result$m_salary[1] - result$m_salary[2])
