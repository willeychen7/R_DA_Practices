-- ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims 
have increased significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed 
a ML based predictive model to identify propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly 
experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims identified by the model. Your objective 
is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. Your output should be 
policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

fraud_score
+----------------------+
| policy_num | varchar |
|    state   | varchar |
| claim_cost |   int   |
|fraud_score |  float  |

## 1. SQL Solution
SELECT policy_num, state, claim_cost, fraud_score
FROM (
    select *,  NTILE(100) OVER(partition by state order by fraud_score desc) as percentile
    from fraud_score) result
WHERE percentile <=5

## 2. R Solution
library(dplyr)

fraud_score <- fraud_score %>%
group_by(state) %>%
mutate(percentile = rank(fraud_score, na.last = "keep", ties.method = "average") / n()) %>%
ungroup()

df <- fraud_score %>%
filter(percentile > 0.95)

result <- df %>%
select(policy_num, state, claim_cost, fraud_score)
